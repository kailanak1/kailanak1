## hey, i'm kai 👋

i like building and using tech that actually makes life easier — less friction, more flow.

when i'm not behind a screen, you’ll probably find me:
- 🥾 hiking and chasing good views  
- 🌊 paddleboarding when the water’s calm  
- 🛠️ tweaking tools, automations, or setups to save time and brainpower  

### what i'm into
- practical software > flashy software  
- tools that remove steps instead of adding them  
- learning by building and breaking things  

🤙 keep paddling
